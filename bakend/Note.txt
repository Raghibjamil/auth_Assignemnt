Important note related to cookie:-

Yes, by default, browsers automatically include cookies associated with a specific domain and path in the Cookie header of HTTP requests to that domain and path. When a user visits a website, the browser sends the cookies related to that domain and path with each subsequent request to that domain.

Here's a typical flow:

The user makes an initial request to a website, and the server responds with a Set-Cookie header to set a cookie in the user's browser.

The browser stores the cookie locally.

For subsequent requests to the same domain and path, the browser automatically includes the stored cookies in the Cookie header of the HTTP request.

It's important to note that there are additional attributes that can be set when creating a cookie (e.g., Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) to control various aspects of cookie behavior and enhance security. The default behavior described above assumes a standard cookie without additional attributes.
